Medical Cost Personal
It is a dataset for regression tasks. It consists of 1300+ records containing persons medical
data and the target is "charge" column. The goal is make a model that fits these data and
predicts the charge for the new persons that the medical insurance should cover. The data
is to be divided to 1000 samples for both training and validation and the rest is for testing.

Project steps are as follows:

1. Load the dataset. (Phase 1)
2. 
3. Prepare the train-validation and test portions. (Phase 1)
4. 
5. Apply any preprocessing or features that you find suitable for the data. (Phase 2)
6. 
7. Apply 3 different models and compare between them. (Phase 3)


NOTE:
1. A comment on the results and on the comparison of the three models applied should be
given.

2. It is expected that the selected models should be experimented with different hyperparameters.
3. 
4. At the final results comparisons, proper metrics should be selected such as: precision,
recall, F1 measure (F-Score), â€¦

4. Error analysis should be stated such as: correctly/wrongly classified examples. Reasons
and suggested improvements should also be included.

5. Teams should select one of these ideas.
6. 
7. Besides selecting one idea of the above, students can select different idea.
